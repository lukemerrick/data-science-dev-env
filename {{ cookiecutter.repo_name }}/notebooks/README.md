# Notebooks
All notebooks live in this directory. If you are about to copy-paste something
from one notebook to another, please remember to refactor it into `src` instead.

## Naming convention
Notebooks should be given a name like this: `1.0-abc-initial-data-exploration.ipynb`.
The number allows ordering of steps, the `abc` here stands for initials, name, or
github user name of the author, and the last piece is a hyphen-delimited description.
